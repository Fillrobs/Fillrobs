        Set random values with appropriate prefixes for the global_id field on
        all existing model entities. The initial schema migration to add the field to the
        model by way of the GlobalIDForAPIMixin will leave all rows
        with the same 8 random characters (and no prefix yet) because the function
        is only called once to calculate the default value for the entire new column
        (https://stackoverflow.com/a/42497696).
        Therefore, we regenerate the 8 random characters to make them different
        across all rows and then add the prefix, like would be done by
        the custom save method for normal object creation.
