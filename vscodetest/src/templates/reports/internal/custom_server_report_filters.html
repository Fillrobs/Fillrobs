BestPractice: dynamic formsets
There are a few things that need to be  to get this working:

1. The formset factory should have extra=0.  Unfortunately, we cannot rely on
extra=1 to show the first form from which others are cloned, because $.formset
doesn't assign IDs correctly (they end up like "fs_prefix-1-id_fs_prefix-0-values").

2. Because of #1, add a hidden row containing the blank form template *after*
the formset loop.  $.formset will use the last row in the table to clone from.
No need to specify `formTemplate` option to $.formset.  Set
`style="display:none"` on this row; using a class to hide it won't work because
cloned forms get that class too.

3. Set up dynamic behaviors such as selectize *after* the row is added. Doing
this in the Django form will cause the supporting js to use the wrong element
IDs since those are altered by $.formset for each row.

4. Don't forget to include the formset management form.  Without this nothing
works.

5. The formset prefix must be used in the formset factory and passed in the
$.formset() call.
