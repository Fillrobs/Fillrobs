Jarmon 10.7


What is this?
=============
jarmon.js contains various wrappers and convenience fuctions for working with
the javascriptRRD, Flot and RRD files generated by eg Collectd.
Additionally, there is a fully working example which demonstrates how to use
jarmon.js and how to integrate it with other javascript components - such as
calendar date pickers etc.


Debian / Ubuntu Quick Start
===========================
There is a demo html page in the docs/examples folder.
To get this demo working, you will need to serve that page from a
local webserver and serve the folder that contains your RRD files.

This demo is designed to work with the RRD files generated by
<a href="http://collectd.org/">Collectd</a>.

# Install and configure collectd (enable the rrd plugin)
$ aptitude install collectd

# Create a project folder and check out the code
$ mkdir -p ~/Projects/Jarmon
$ cd ~/Projects/Jarmon
$ bzr branch lp:~richardw/jarmon/trunk
$ cd trunk

# Link to the collectd rrd folder
$ ln -s /var/lib/collectd/rrd/localhost docs/examples/data

# Start a local webserver - here we use Twisted, but there are other web server
# config examples in docs/
$ aptitude install twisted
$ twistd -n web --port 8080 --path .

$ firefox http://localhost:8080/docs/examples/index.html
