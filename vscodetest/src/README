The folder /opt/cloudbolt is the CloudBolt product directory.
Please note that it will be overwritten on each CB upgrade.

If you have any customizations, extensions, or scripts that you've made,
put then under /var/opt/cloudbolt instead.

For more information on all things CloudBolt, our current docs can be found at
docs.cloudbolt.io, or by clicking the life preserver link in your CB UI.
