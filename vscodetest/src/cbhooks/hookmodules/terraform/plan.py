    `plan` runs after `init`, and returns flags and environment variables used
    by the underlying `terraform plan` command.

    Note: This function _must_ return the `output` Tuple. Any additional
        side-effects can occur during this function execution, but changing
        the return type will cause Terraform execution to break.

    Args:
        hook (TerraformPlanHook): The "Terraform Plan" Action that's called from
            a Blueprint.
        job (Job): Async "Job" object that's associated with running this `hook`.
        action_inputs (dict): Map of key:value variables that are passed to this
            Terraform Action.
        resource (Resource): "Resource" object that Terraform will populate /
            provision to.
        service_item (RunTerraformPlanHookServiceItem): The Blueprint item
            associated with this "Terraform Plan" Action.
        tf_env_vars (Dict[str, str]): Environment variables used by Terraform
            for this command (`terraform plan`).

            state file.
        plan_file (str): Absolute file path to the Terraform plan file.

            variables file.
